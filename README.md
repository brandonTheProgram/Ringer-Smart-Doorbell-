# Ringer-Smart-Doorbell-

This was a project that I created with a partner for a summer program at UCI called Inspire in which we had to create a smart doorbell using a raspberry Pi. This code transforms a raspberry Pi into a smart doorbell.

# How it works
When a person presses the button on the Pi, the Pi Camera will take a picture of them and send the image to the owners phone. The owner can respond with a message that the doorbell would speak back to the person whom rang it via text to speech using ESpeak. If the owner was to trigger the alarm, the doorbell would blast an alarm to scare the person away from the house. To use, replace the XXXs with the coresponding information to enable the device to work properly
